# Motivation

- The armv7m package uses semihosting to display debugging information.
- The current implementation causes a debugger trap for every character sent.
- On some platforms this is extremely slow, in the order of 1 character / sec.

# Goals

- Speed up the semihosting debug output by allowing the debug code to transmit strings in a single trap.
- Modify the existing generic debug code to support sending strings in a single message

# Test Plan

- All platforms implement the generic debugging interface, so test systems on these platforms.
- All existing regression tests must pass.
