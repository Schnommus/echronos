# Motivation

The main branch against which development happens is called `development` although the default name in git repositories is `master`.
In the project history so far, there was no need for or benefit in deviating from this default.
It is an unnecessary hurdle for new developers, in particular since it leads to a misleading git error message when cloning the repository.


# Goals

- update all references to the `development` branch in the repository (in code and documentation) to `master`
- once the task has been approved of and integrated:
    - rename `development` branch itself to `master`
    - update all CI systems accordingly


# Test Plan

- code reviews
- existing regression tests must pass
