arm-kochab-preempt
    Merge back redesigned armv7m preemption mechanism for Kochab from SMACCM development head.

kochab-mutex-timeout
    Implement a timeout version of mutex_lock available on Kochab using the existing timer framework.

kochab-sem-timeout
    Implement a timeout version of sem_wait available on Kochab using the existing timer framework.

useful-sem-defines
    MUTEX_ID_ZERO and MUTEX_ID_MAX are currently exposed in the RTOS user API.
    If even only for consistency, it makes sense that SEM_ID_ZERO and SEM_ID_MAX are similarly exposed.

cpp-friendly-headers
    For users calling into the RTOS from C++, function declarations in the user API header need to be surrounded by an
    'extern "C" { }' block dependent on #ifdef __cplusplus.

arm-fp-ctxt-switch
    For users who need it, floating-point registers on ARM need to be stored and restored on context switch.

kochab-documentation
    There is currently no documentation for the Kochab component, and possibly other components Kochab depends on.
    Now that the Rigel documentation task has merged, the docs.md build support exists.
    There needs to be a task that makes the Kochab documentation complete.

audit-preempt-disable
    Audit all disabling of preemption in the RTOS and ensure that these regions are as tight as safely possible.

ppc-test-coverage
    Context switch test coverage for FP + ABI-specific functionality on PowerPC.

ppc-toolchain
    x.py ppc support with fully-integrated ppc toolchain, qemu.
