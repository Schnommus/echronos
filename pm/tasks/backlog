arm-kochab-preempt
    Merge back redesigned armv7m preemption mechanism for Kochab from SMACCM development head.

kochab-mutex-timeout
    Implement a timeout version of mutex_lock available on Kochab using the existing timer framework.

arm-fp-ctxt-switch
    For users who need it, floating-point registers on ARM need to be stored and restored on context switch.

kochab-documentation
    There is currently no documentation for the Kochab component, and possibly other components Kochab depends on.
    Now that the Rigel documentation task has merged, the docs.md build support exists.
    There needs to be a task that makes the Kochab documentation complete.

audit-preempt-disable
    Audit all disabling of preemption in the RTOS and ensure that these regions are as tight as safely possible.

signal-prio-inherit
    Currently, priority inheritance is only supported by sched-prio-inherit for mutexes.
    Arguably it would be more intuitive if signals provided priority inheritance for the typical case where a task waits for a specific signal from another task.

ppc-fp-ctxt-switch
    For users who need it, floating-point registers on PowerPC need to be stored and restored on context switch.

ppc-test-coverage
    Context switch test coverage for FP + ABI-specific functionality on PowerPC.

ppc-toolchain
    x.py ppc support with fully-integrated ppc toolchain, qemu.

message-queues
    improve test coverage so that regression tests are run continuously

cleanup-prefix-hardcoding
    Get rid of the 'rtos_' prefix wherever it's hardcoded to facilitate access by other modules, once the 'rtos-config-global' feature allows us to simply determine the prefix from the RTOS module's configuration environment.
