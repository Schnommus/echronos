sem-max-init
    Support optional configuration of semaphore limits that cause a fatal error if exceeded.

arm-kochab-preempt
    Merge back redesigned armv7m preemption mechanism for Kochab from SMACCM development head.

mutex-lock-timeout
    Implement a timeout version of mutex_lock using the existing timer framework.

kochab-timer
    Add timer functionality to the Kochab variant for all platforms.
    This has to be done before sem-wait-timeout, since Kochab is currently the only variant that uses semaphores.

sem-wait-timeout
    Implement a timeout version of sem_wait using the existing timer framework.

arm-ext-irq-config
    There currently exists a pystache stub in the armv7m vectable.s that would populate the vector table with handler addresses for external IRQs, but no XML schema nor scripting to actually allow them to be supplied via the .prx file.
    We have an implementation for this on the SMACCM development head ready to be backported.

useful-sem-defines
    MUTEX_ID_ZERO and MUTEX_ID_MAX are currently exposed in the RTOS user API.
    If even only for consistency, it makes sense that SEM_ID_ZERO and SEM_ID_MAX are similarly exposed.

ppc-test-coverage
    Context switch test coverage for FP + ABI-specific functionality on PowerPC.

ppc-toolchain
    x.py ppc support with fully-integrated ppc toolchain, qemu.
