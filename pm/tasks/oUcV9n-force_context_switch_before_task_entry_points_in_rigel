# Motivation

Currently, the rigel variant optionally makes tasks wait for a startup signal before executing their application-defined entry points.
For tasks that use this mechanism, they always yield before executing their entry point.
For tasks that do not use this mechanism, they execute their entry point without a task switch occurring beforehand.
This asymmetry is undesirable in some customer scenarios where context switching also drives other system features.


# Goals

The goal of this task is to ensure that all task application code executes only after having performed a context switch.
The approach is to make tasks that do not wait for a start-up signal yield at the start of the wrappers for their task entry functions.


# Test Plan

- code review
- existing regression tests must pass
