Task: fpxF4P-add_github_issue_and_pr_templates_and_consolidate_with_task_description_template
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

Currently, the workflow for task management does not integrate github at all.
This is unattractive for external contributors.
For example, github issues and pull requests could, but currently do not use the same template and information as the current task descriptions.

Goals
--------

The goals of this task are to

- set up templates for github issues and pull requests;
- make sure that x.py uses that same template for task descriptions generated by the command `x.py task create`.

Test Plan
---------

- code review
- create new task and check whether the task description file is identical to the github template
