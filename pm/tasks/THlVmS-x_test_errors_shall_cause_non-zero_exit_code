Task: THlVmS-x_test_errors_shall_cause_non-zero_exit_code
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

The command `./x.py test x` runs a range of regression tests for the `x` tool.
When one of those tests fails due to an error, such as an exception, it results in a highly visible error message.
However, the tool exits with an exit code of 0, which should only by the case when all tests pass.
This is due to only checking for non-error test failures when determining the exit code.


Goals
--------

- when a test executed by the command `./x.py test x` fails in any manner, the command shell exit with a non-zero exit code


Test Plan
---------

- locally edit `x_test.py` and change the value of the `INITIAL_COMMIT` variable to an arbitrary value
- check that the command `./x.py test x` exits with a non-zero exit code
