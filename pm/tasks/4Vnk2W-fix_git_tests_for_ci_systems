Task: 4Vnk2W-fix_git_tests_for_ci_systems
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

The regression tests `test_git_branch_hash()` and `test_git_branch_date()` in `x_test.py` currently fail or are not run on continuous integration test systems.
They rely on the first revision on the `development` branch to be available in the git history.
However, CI systems typically do not retrieve the entire git history for running tests.
Therefore, the git revision the tests rely on to be available is not.

Alternatively, the tests can dynamically use ony git revision for the test that they determine dynamically.


Goals
--------

- ensure that the git tests run and pass on CI systems
- change the git tests so that they use any available git revision that they determine dynamically


Test Plan
---------

- review code changes
- existing regression tests must pass
- git tests must be executed and pass on CI system
