Task: rDzBUS-kZfrrA-remove_setenv_shell_script
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

Currently, the repository contains the shell script `setenv`.
It updates the `PATH` environment variable so as to include the platform-specific build tools from the `tools` directory.
On UNIX-based platforms, users are supposed to _source_ this script in order for it to affect the environment variables of their shell session.
On Windows-based platforms, this script is not used and the build tools are expected to be installed system wide and always available via `PATH`.

This approach has two downsides:
- it is a hassle and a hurdle for users to take the extra step of sourcing the `setenv` script and it is easy to forget
- it is an inconsistent user experience across platforms

The RTOS build system relies on the updated `PATH` variable only in the build modules invoked via the `prj` utility.
The task of selecting, finding, and using the correct build tools could just as well be moved there.
This would eliminate the need for the `setenv` script.


Goals
--------

- remove `setenv` script along with documentation and tests that refer to it
- determine an appropriate new home in `prj` tool or the build modules for `setenv`'s functionality of selecting and finding the correct platform-specific build tools
- extend `prj` tool or build modules accordingly
- configure CI server so that it does not use `setenv` script


Test Plan
---------

- code review
- existing regression tests
- ensure that applications can be built successfully from RTOS releases
