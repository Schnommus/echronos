# Motivation

Travis CI is configured to deploy the build output from certain revisions to GitHub as RTOS releases.
It is also configured to run the tests with different Python versions in parallel.
Unfortunately, each parallel test run attempts to deploy the build output.
Since this can lead to concurrency conflicts, one or more deploy steps may fail, causing the whole build to be considered as failed.


# Goals

- The overall goal of this task is to ensure that release deployments from Travis CI to GitHub succeed when they can be reasonably expected to do so.
- Specifically, only one set of build outputs from all parallel builds shall be deployed to GitHub to avoid concurrency issues.
- As a minor cleanup, the Travis CI build badge in README.md shall refer to the master branch instead of the outdated development branch.


# Test Plan

- Verify that all existing regression tests pass.
- Verify that the changes meet the task goals and follow project conventions.
- Create a test tag: `git tag test_tag origin/travis_ci_shall_not_deploy_releases_in_parallel`
- Push tag to GitHub: `git push origin test_tag`
- Wait for Travis CI to build test tag
- Verify that across the parallel builds, only one resulted in a deployment
- Verify that the deployment resulted in a release on GitHub
- Delete test tag: `git tag -d test_tag`
- Delete test tag from GitHub: `git push origin :test_tag`
- Delete test release on GitHub
