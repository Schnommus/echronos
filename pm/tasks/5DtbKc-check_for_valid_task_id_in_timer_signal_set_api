# Motivation

By convention, RTOS APIs check the validity of application-supplied arguments via API assertions.
The `timer_signal_set()` API in the _timer_ component has three arguments, `timer_id`, `task_id`, and `signal_set`.
Of these arguments, only `timer_id` is checked with an API assertion.

At the moment, applications can pass an invalid `task_id` to `timer_signal_set()`.
This makes the RTOS write to the internal `signal_tasks.tasks` array at an out-of-bounds index when the timer expires.
This likely overwrites RTOS or application data structures and is therefore detrimental to system correctness.
Therefore, `timer_signal_set()` shall check via an API assertion that the `task_id` argument contains a valid value.
This will help detect incorrect invocations by applications.


# Goals

- check for `task_id` argument values of the `timer_signal_set()` API that may impact system correctness
- add API assertions that assert that `task_id` is a valid task ID


# Test Plan

- existing regression tests must pass
- code review
