# Motivation

The command `x.py test systems` runs several system-level regression tests.
Currently, the command exits with the exit code 0 when one or more tests fail.
This makes it unnecessarily difficult and error prone to check for test failures on regression test systems.


# Goals

- the command `x.py test systems` shall exit with a non-zero exit code when one or more tests fail


# Test Plan

- code review
- existing regression tests shall pass
- check efficacy of change:
    - locally modify a system test so that it fails
    - run `x.py test systems`
    - verify that it exits with a non-zero exit code
