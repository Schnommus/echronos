# Motivation

By convention, RTOS APIs check the validity of application-supplied arguments via API assertions.
The `timer_signal_set()` API in the _timer_ component has three arguments, `timer_id`, `task_id`, and `signal_set`.
The argument `signal_set` is not checked with an API assertion.

Only when an application passes a non-zero `signal_set` to `timer_signal_set()` does the _timer_ component behave in a manner that is practically relevant and useful to applications.
When `signal_set` is the empty set and the timer expires
- the timer is always marked as overflowed and
- no signal set is sent to the configured task.
There is no apparent use case for this behavior.
Therefore, `timer_signal_set()` shall check via an API assertion that `signal_set` is not empty.

Alternatively, `signal_set` may be an arbitrary, non-zero signal set that is not defined by the system configuration.
The RTOS currently has no mechanism to check for undefined signals.

Therefore, the `timer_signal_set()` API should implement API assertions to check that argument.
This will help detect incorrect invocations by applications.


# Goals

- add API assertion to `timer_signal_set()` that asserts that `signal_set` is not the empty set
- update documentation with this restriction on the argument values


# Test Plan

- existing regression tests must pass
- code review
