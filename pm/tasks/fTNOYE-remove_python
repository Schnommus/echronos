Task: fTNOYE-remove_python
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

The RTOS repository and releases are, at least for the Linux and OS-X host platforms, packaged with a Python 3.3 interpreter.
The original motivation behind this bundling is to make the RTOS repository and releases as independent of external dependencies as reasonably possible.

While this motivation still holds, bundling Python also has disadvantages:
- Python 3.3 is now obsolete and no longer receives updates
- it is not straightforward to update the bundled Python interpreter to a more recent version
- enforcing the use of a specific Python interpreter can be limiting, e.g., when attempting to build the RTOS on a 32-bit version of Linux, as the bundled Python interpreter is a 64-bit binary

At the same time, the Python interpreter is a reasonably standard and stable dependency that is usually widely available and trivial to set up and maintain on a host system.
On Windows, the RTOS utilities rely on using a default installation of Python which has not caused any issues that a bundled Windows Python interpreter would have prevented.
In general, it is not clear whether the bundled Python interpreter for Linux and OS-X has prevented issue to a degree that justifies the effort required to bundle the interpreter in the first place.

Therefore, it is feasible and probably advantageous to remove the bundled Python interpreter and instead rely on the Python interpreters available on host systems.


Goals
--------

- remove Python interpreter bundled with RTOS repository
- remove checks that enforce using the bundled interpreter with the x and prj utilities
- build prj utility as a zip archive executable with Python instead of building a standalone binary
- adapt build, release, and test infrastructure where necessary

Test Plan
---------

- all existing regression tests must pass
