Task: C2EDKy-splint_support
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

Static code analysis can help to identify poor code quality and functional issues without explicit testing.
Supporting such tools can help to further improve and maintain the code quality of the RTOS.


Goals
--------

- extend the existing x or prj tools with support for running the splint static code analysis tool (http://www.splint.org/)
- where necessary and reasonable, modify the RTOS code so that it passes the default splint checks

- it is not a goal of this task to implement as strict as possible splint checks;
  this can be addressed in follow-up tasks


Test Plan
---------

- code review, in particular of the added regression tests
- existing and new regression tests must pass
