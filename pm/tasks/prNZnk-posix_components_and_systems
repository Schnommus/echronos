Task: prNZnk-posix_components_and_systems
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

The existing task switch component for POSIX only allows building a small set of RTOS variants.
However, having more components available for POSIX would allow being able to build and run more complex variants as POSIX user-space processes.
This is useful for education, training, system and application prototyping, and debugging.


Goals
--------

- implement remaining platform-dependent components for POSIX API
- define acamar, acrux, krux, and rigel variants for POSIX
- create sample systems and system tests for these variants


Test Plan
---------

- code review
- must pass existing and added regression tests
