Task: HaJ2AE-fix_typo_and_include_path_for_splint_static_analysis_on_windows
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

The command `py -3 prj/app/prj.py analyze <system>` statically analyzes the specified system for defects using the `splint` tool.
On Windows, there are two issues that prevent this static analysis from working as expected:

# `splint` does not use the standard include paths of the preprocessor used to build the system.
  Therefore, `splint`'s own preprocessing fails because it cannot find standard header files, such as `stdint.h`.
# When `splint` fails, an exception is raised, which is supposed to be handled to provide additional information about the failure.
  However, there is a typo in the `except` clause that prevents the exception from being handled correctly.


Goals
--------

The goal of this task is to resolve the two issues above so that `splint` successfully analyzes systems on Windows.


Test Plan
---------

- code review
- existing regression tests
- check that the following commands succeed on Windows with splint and MinGW installed from a Windows command prompt:

    py -3 x.py build packages
    py -3 prj/app/prj.py build stub.acamar
    py -3 prj/app/prj.py analyze stub.acamar
