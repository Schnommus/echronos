Task: Umwqbe-upgrade_system_tests_to_gdb_7.12
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

Currently, the PowerPC-based system tests rely on GDB 7.9 with PowerPC support.
That version of GDB is built from GNU binutils which by now no longer include GDB which has been moved to a separate package.
This went hand in hand with a change in the name of the GDB executable.

This raises the following issues:
- the instructions in `README.md` are no longer up-to-date
- with the latest version of GDB, the system tests fail


Goals
--------

- resolve above issues
- update the instructions in `README.md` to apply to a specific recent version of GDB
- update the PowerPC system tests to work with that version of GDB


Test Plan
---------

- review changes
- existing regression tests
- check in particular that PowerPC system tests are executed and pass
