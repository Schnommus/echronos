Task: kpS51x-bugfix_for_incorrect_dependency_in_x_build_partials
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

The command "x.py build partials" attempts to build a release before building the partial release files.
This is an incorrect circular dependency and "x.py build partials" must only build the partial release files themselves, not a complete release.

This issue is a relic of the task branch t7Kb5l-rename_x_commands.
It was not picked up by regression tests because it only manifests when building the partials in a clean directory which the regression test system does not necessarily do.


Goals
--------

- remove the call to "build(args)" in line 389 of pylib/release.py so that the x command "build partials" does not attempt to build a complete release


Test Plan
---------

- existing regression tests with clean build directories
