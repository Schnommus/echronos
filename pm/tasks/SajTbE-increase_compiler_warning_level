Task: SajTbE-increase_compiler_warning_level
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

The compiler is able to point out a wide range of potential issues with code quality if configured to do so.
The core components are currently compiled for the stub architecture with a reasonable, but not overly strict warning level.
Increasing the warning level for at least this core code can help with overall code quality.


Goals
--------

- enable additional warnings in the gcc compiler through additional compiler options in the build module of the stub architecture
- improve code where necessary to resolve warnings raised through the increased warning level


Test Plan
---------

- code review
- existing regression tests must pass
