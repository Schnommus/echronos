w/ 10k trials: -O2, after flag streamlining optimization
- No MPU, No inline traps (context switches ONLY) = 48 cycles
- MPU shortcut, inline traps (inline traps + context switches ONLY) = 93 cycles
- MPU full = 194 cycles

Force loop unroll MPU full = 164 cycles (reconfigure = 71 cycles)
Hand ASM. MPU alias banks (no longer M0/M1+ compatible) =
    151 cycles (reconfigure = 58 cycles)

but sloth - 180 (MPU+itraps cost) + 39 (base) = 219 cycles

overall delta (eChronos): 164 - 48 = 116 cycles
overall delta (sloth): 180 cycles
